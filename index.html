			<h2>Habitat</h2>
			<img src="images/koala_2.jpg">
	
			<p>While koalas currently arenâ€™t listed as an endangered species, 80 percent of koala habitat has been lost to human homes and businesses, drought, and fires. That makes life hard for an animal that needs eucalyptus forests to survive, like koalas do. Koalas also are at risk when close to human populations and being killed by cars or dogs. Many people are working together to protect koala habitat and help these cuddly looking creatures survive.</p>
